		<h1>Revelation's structure</h1>
		<p>
			The book of Revelation is written in a symmetrical A, B, C, B, A pattern.  This pattern is common to Hebrew literature.  It is often known as a "chiasm" structure.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the outline of the chiasm:
		</p>
		<div>
			<Outline />
		</div>
		<p>
			Click on the letters to go to that section in the main view.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				In the main view, clicking on the colored bar to the left of each chiasm section will zoom in on that section plus its mirror section.
			</strong>
		</p>
		<h2>
			Septets
		</h2>
		<p>
			Other than the prologue and epilogue, each section of the chiasm is comprised of an introduction, and a "septet" (7 parts).
		</p>
		<p>
			Each piece of the septet often relates to its matching piece in the mirror section of the overall chiasm.  Here are the septets within each chiasm section:
		</p>
		<div>
			<Subsections />
		</div>
		<p>
			In the main view, after you have zoomed in to a specific part of the overall chiasm, you can see the septets identified with colored bars.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				In the main view, click on the colored bar next to a septet section to compare that part to its mirror septet section.
			</strong>
		</p>
		<h2>
			The chiasm at the center of the book
		</h2>
		<p>
			The introduction to section E, the middle part of the chiasm, is itself another chiasm:
		</p>
		<div>
			<!-- <InnerChiasm /> -->
		</div>
